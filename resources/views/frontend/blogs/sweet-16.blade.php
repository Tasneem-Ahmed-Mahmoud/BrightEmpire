                                    <p>As limos are big and not usual car, people are tempted to do all different things
                                        that otherwise are seen as dangerous in a small car. But guess what, a limo is
                                        also
                                        a car on the road and all safety measures apply to it as well. A lot of times,
                                        people are tempted to imitate their favorite celebrities riding a limo, standing
                                        up
                                        through the sunroof, and screaming at the top of their lungs. Many unfortunate
                                        accidents have taken place due to this over-excited behavior.</p>
